# Dimantic 

Dimantic offers **high quality collective communication** and **personal 
control over your own attention**.

We achieve this by implementing a free attention market, where instead of 
a centralized algorithm, you configure your own filters.

And to ensure high quality, every action costs **attention credit**, but AC can be
gained back if the action is valuable to the collective.

You can even gain more AC than you spent - so every action is an investment. 

We have identified the short term drive for shareholder value maximisation as 
the core problem of the current attention economy, as in social media.
Therefore, we strive to not include any shareholders in our business model; 
off course there needs to be some kind of monetary engine to ensure enough 
resources, so the whole project is a business, but an idealistic one.

All interactions happen in spaces, so there is no "global" community, which allows
us to not enforce "community guidelines" other than basic laws.

Spaces are a digital space, which govern themselves - since there can be infinite spaces
the competition between them allows for a natural selection of the best spaces.

### Super-Spaces & Global Discourse
To ensure that there is a higher level discourse, there is a limited number of super
spaces, which are managed by dimantic itself. Users cannot join a super space - only 
other spaces can.

Each super space has a different topic - so within a super space, there is a competition
for the highest value content - which is then broadcasted to all users of the platform.

Since their number is starkly limited, the competition enforces a high quality of content 
and an interaction between otherwise isolated parts of the wider society.
