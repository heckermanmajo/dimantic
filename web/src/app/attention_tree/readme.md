# Attention Tree 

A tree of attention direction from the top to the bottom.

Can be generated from the system or mark a session.

-> can also be edited.

-> You can view attention trees
-> sessions, so you can explore a topic and get other topics suggested.


### People can also reference other content and get awarded for it.

### Types of nodes:

- filter: you can filter my spaces, soe topic, a specific search, etc.
  - the option to reload on ever login, f.e. for posts I created, etc.
- attention opportunity
- text note to myself
  - you can add all nodes you want by hand
- space (super, private, default)
- content or sub discussion
- auto generated nodes appear with a different color
  - f.e. attention opportunities
- you can share parts of the attention tree with others
- you can append parts of an attention tree to a post, etc.


### Mobile solution
-> you can not edit the tree, but display "feeds" from some 
   nodes you mark as "available for mobile".
